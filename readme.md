Simple tool which can be used to calculate average grade for university. Made using HTML, CSS and JS

I made this tool to calculate average grade for each year of my university.

I am planning on adding feature which will store all the grades in backend and user can see it anytime.

The goal is to make it work and not make it look good but both is bonus
